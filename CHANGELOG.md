## 1.0.1 (2023-06-02)
  
Initial version. Contains the simplest graph interface and implementation.

There is no available version 1.0.0 because I made a mistake while designing the publish pipeline. Then I accidentally published a draft version of the package under version 1.0.0. As you know, once published packages cannot be removed or overwritten.
